My principle interests are lifelong learning, brain stimulation and neuroimaging. Currently, I work on investigating the effects of neurostimulation on reading using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. I'm also working with transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalogram in the near future to investigate effects of exercise on cognition.
