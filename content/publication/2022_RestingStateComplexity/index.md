abstract: 'Resting state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) is a non-invasive and inexpensive measure of neural activity, with rest presenting a unique, individual-specific condition (i.e., situation-independent) for tapping into the spontaneous cognitive processes associated with the organized "baseline state" of the brain (Fair et al., 2008; Raichle et al., 2001). Neuronal dynamics during rest (i.e., in the absence of any stimuli or task) has revealed interesting associations with psychopathological disorders [e.g., schizophrenia, (Zhao et al., 2013); depression (Meerwijk et al., 2015)], neurodegeneration [Stam et al., 2006; Meghdadi et al., 2021), executive functioning (Perone, Palanisamy & Carlson, 2018), and even stable inter-individual differences [e.g., intelligence, (Lutzenberger et al., 1992); personality traits, (Jausovec & Jausovec, 2007); age (Anderson & Perone, 2018]. In recent years, EEG analysis has advanced beyond spectral analyses to include methods drawn from nonlinear dynamics (Goldberger, 1996; Li et al., 2020) to capture the complexity of the brain. While there is an abundance of studies studying rsEEG complexity in neuropathology [e.g., migraine attacks (Cao et al., 2017); Parkinson's disease (Yi et al., 2016)] in the pursuit of achieving better diagnostic outcomes, its correlates with the conscious experience of individuals in healthy populations still remain unclear. In this study, we attempt to examine the relationship between inter-individual differences in EEG complexity and individuals' subjective experiences at rest.'
