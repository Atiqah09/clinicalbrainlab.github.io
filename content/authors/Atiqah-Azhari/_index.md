Atiqah is a Research Fellow at NTU who is passionate about investigating the brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying naturalistic interpersonal interactions. She uses functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning and behavioural coding to examine how interpersonal neural synchrony and behavioural synchrony govern important social outcomes such as quality of relationships, group collaboration, team performance and learning.
