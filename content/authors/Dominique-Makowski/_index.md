Trained as neuropsychologist, CBT psychotherapist (and hypnotherapist), I am currently working as a postdoc at the Clinical Brain Lab in Singapore on the neuroscience of deception üòè. 
I‚Äôm fluent in French, English, Polish, Python, and somewhat good at pretending to speak Italian. My main figures of reference are Epictetus, Churchill and Yoda. My interests include scientific methodology, history of art and religion, as well as philosophy. 
My research focuses on aspects of reality bending (e.g., fiction, deception or altered states of consciousness such as through meditation or immersion).
