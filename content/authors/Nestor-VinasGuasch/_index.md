Nestor's research combines behavioral and imaging techniques to study the interface between cognition and language. He is interested in cases that ‘deviate’ from the norm, such as multilinguals or special populations, and he believes these can provide further cues into the functioning of the human brain and mind. Along these lines, he has researched the cognitive effects of bilingualism in children and adults, the role of verbal working memory in schizophrenia patients, verbal fluency in stroke patients, and more recently, the contribution of inner speech and brain stimulation to language acquisition. He is also particularly interested in the involvement of subcortical structures and the cerebellum in higher cognitive processes.
