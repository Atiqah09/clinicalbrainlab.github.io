title: BrainConnects 2019
subtitle: Bridging Brains - Enriching Minds
event: On its 6th year, BrainConnects takes a big step in holding its annual meeting in the Philippines. As a Special Interest Group for Neuroinformatics of Aging, it has fostered the exchange of knowledge towards the understanding of aging related brain changes and mechanisms of disease through neuroimaging technologies. It has continuously engaged and successfully connected premier Pacific - Asian institutions in high-resource countries on this special field. Yet population aging is a worldwide phenomenon across all economic status and Asia is soon to be home to more than half of the elderly population. The theme of BrainConnects 2019, "Bridging Brains Enriching Minds" is most apt as it connects to the Philippines intending to raise awareness on neuroinformatics of aging, encourage the exchange of ideas, spur collaboration, and hopefully champion innovation in aging interventions. This year's program will showcase presentations from six participating countries with topics on basic and advanced neuroimaging methods and discussions on cognitively healthy aging, pathology, diagnostics and intervention.
