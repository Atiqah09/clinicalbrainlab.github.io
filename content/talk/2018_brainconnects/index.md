title: BrainConnects 2018
subtitle: The Science of Learning in the Aging Brain 
event: The aim of BrainConnects is to develop and share methods and technologies for delaying and modulating cognitive and physical decline in aging or pathophysiologic changes in older adults. This year, our theme will focus on the Science of Learning in the Aging Brain. We hope to explore and merge cognitive neuroscience, neurotechnologies, and clinical/social medicine to optimize learning in the aging brain and develop research to implement the outcomes for graceful aging. As an interdisciplinary activity that has been successful from the past four meetings, BrainConnects 2018 aims to address strategies that can help develop effective neuromodulation methods for physical and cognitive intervention towards successful aging.
