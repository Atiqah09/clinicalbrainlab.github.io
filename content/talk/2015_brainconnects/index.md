subtitle: 
event: This collaborative research proposes to investigate functional and structural neural networks that are sensitive to age-related changes to address the issues in global aging from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. The research aims to provide direction in targeting the relevant networks as plausible neuroimaging markers for cognitive training and hopefully prevent or modulate normal cognitive decline. We have started to establish a sensitive protocol to measure cognitive changes of clinical significance in aging in Japan and Singapore. This collaboration will continue to develop and implement a standard neuroimaging protocol applicable to both Singapore and Japan, as well as conduct possible cross-cultural aging studies.
